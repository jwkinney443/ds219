Hello!!

I'm Jack (or formally John) Kinney.

I'm a senior at Boston University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
As a software engineer, I'm passionate about building innovative and practical solutions 
that make everyday life easier and more enjoyable.

It is hard to say exactly what my favorite course so far at Boston University has been.
I love full stack development and handling large sets of data 
so I have enjoyed the following a lot: CS391, CS411, CS412, CS506
